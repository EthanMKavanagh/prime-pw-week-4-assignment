# Tier 1 Week 4

This week we'll be pulling together all of the Javascript techniques you've learned thus far:

- variables
- arrays
- conditionals
- functions

These will be applied in an inventory system for a long term parking garage. This will be done in many steps so let's break it down into digestible chunks.

## Calling Functions in Your Code

The Chrome interactive console a great tool but does not reflect the reality of testing your code or calling functions from within your code. Ultimately you will have lots of code "talking" to other code, and this must happen in the program itself.

Call your functions in your JS file with the test cases you used, like:

```
console.log( parkCar() ); // empty!
console.log( parkCar('chevy') );
console.log( parkCar('dodge') );
console.log( parkCar('tesla') );
console.log( isParkedHere('ford') ); // expect false
// etc
```

## Required Features

### Global variables and pushing to an array

- create a variable named "parkedCars" and set it to an empty array
- create a `const` named "maxCars" and set it to 5

### the `parkCar` function

- create a function called `parkCar` that will receive a car name.
- When called [ ex: `parkCar('PT Cruiser')` ] that car name should be pushed into the array "parkedCars"
- this should happen only if there is room in the garage. Hint: check the length of the array to determine how many cars are in the garage. Check this against the "maxCars" const to check if there is room in the garage
- if the car was pushed into the array, return `true`, if there was no room and the car wouldn't fit return `false`

### Styling with `CSS` 

Now let's practice some CSS! for this, we will go back to our index.html to start:

- Place the `<h1>` and `<p>` inside of a header and add a background-color to that header
- Create a stylesheet.css file and import it into the index.html file.
- Add a new div with a class name of "info". Inside that div add an `<h2> My name is YOUR NAME </h2>` Add a background-color and a text color of your choice.
- Add an image tag `<img>` and source an image of your main mode of transportation (you car, bus, scooter, bike, feet, etc)
- Add an `<h3>` that explains your mode of transportation. Add a background-color and a text color of your choice.

**REMINDER:** Make sure to answer the Slack discussion question for this week!

The style should look something like this (image shown has a little more CSS - feel free to try some new things!)

## Stretch Goals

### the `isParkedHere` function

- write a function named `isParkedHere` that receives a car named
- when run [ex: `isParkedHere('Ford Escape')` ], the function should return `true` if that car is parked in the garage
- return `false` if not found in the garage

### the `takeForASpin` function

- write a function named `takeForASpin` that receives a car name
- this function should use `isParkedHere` to determine if the car for which you are looking is in this garage
- if so, remove this car from the "parkedCars" array and return the car name (hint: look up `splice` for help on removing an item from an array)
- if not, return `false`


### Add Color

Add color to your cars! Update the `parkCar` function to accept a color parameter, and then update the `takeForASpin` function to allow the color to be used to search for a car. 

For Example:

- If we add a Red PT Cruiser to our array with `parkCar('PT Cruiser', 'Red')`
- We should be able to run `takeForASpin('Red')` or `takeForASpin('PT Cruiser')` and find the car. If it is not there, we should still get `false`.

How would you go about storing additional information for this car? What if you wanted to store year, make, model, VIN, owner, and a bunch of other information?  (Hint: research objects)

ANSWER:
In an object:
car = {
    year: year
    make: make
    model: model
    VIN: vin
    owner: owner
}
